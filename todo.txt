Stage 1 (pre-compiled components)
- content projection
- Angular is running in development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable production mode.
- respect all rendering modes
- verify different style encapsulation
- if some packages are not installed, there will be an error, that is hard to understand
- zone.js attached twice (client and ssr)?

Stage 2 (defined components within the qwik app)
- analog angular and qwikVite plugin conflicts

Other:
- no event after navigating to another page and back? (qwik issue)
- is it ok to attach zone.js globally? 
- EventEmitter: CustomEvent vs functional handlers?
