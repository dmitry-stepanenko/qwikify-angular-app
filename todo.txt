Stage 1 (pre-compiled components)
- SSR content projection (client side works)
- Angular is running in development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable production mode.
- verify different style encapsulation
- if some packages are not installed, there will be an error, that is hard to understand
- Verify zone.js is attached correctly (now it's done twice on client and server)

Stage 2 (defined components within the qwik app)
- analog angular and qwikVite plugin conflicts

Other:
- no event after navigating to another page and back? (qwik issue)
- is it ok to attach zone.js globally? 
- EventEmitter: CustomEvent vs functional handlers approach? both supported now, leave one)
- no esbuild async/await support
